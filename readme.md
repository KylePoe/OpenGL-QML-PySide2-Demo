# qml-opengl-demo

This example is a simple reimplementation of the squircle example in `PyQt5`.

`main.qml` is not changed and anything else is reimplemented in `PyQt5` equivalently. 
 
 __note__: This simple demo is tested in Ubuntu 16.04, but for some OpenGL reason it's not working in macOS Sierra. To be tested.
